# find_error

`find_error` accepts error number(s) generated by [Sony Remote Camera SDK](https://support.d-imaging.sony.co.jp/app/sdk/en/index.html) and displays error code in text.
This app generates C header source from CrError.h in CrSDK_v1.

## Build

Build from command line. Assume your current folder is that of this readme.

```bash
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ..
> make
```

## Usage

```bash
> find_error errno [errno ...]
```

`errno` is the return value of CrSDK functions those returns `CrError`.

## Example

`EnumCameraObjects()`, which is used in `RemoteCli.cpp`, usually returns `0`, but it ocasionally returns `34563`. You can find its meaning by running:

```bash
> ./find_error 34563
Error [34563] = [CrError_Adaptor_Create]
```

Indeed, this happens when CrSDK fails to find additional libraries in `CrAdapter`.
